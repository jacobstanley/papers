Here is our new definition of the @Arbitrary@ class.

\begin{code}
class Arbitrary a where
   arbitrary :: Gen (Tree a)
\end{code}

Our generator now produces a candidate value and a lazy tree of all its possible reductions, rather than just a single candidate at a time. Give the data type definition for @Tree@. Give some examples of trees.
