\section{Shrinking Subterms}

One of the challenges with the rose tree approach is how to shrink a term to one of its subterms.

\TODO{describe @freeze@, @shrink@, and the @withSubterms@ combinator}

\TODO{this section probably needs to be after the transformers one as we'd like to use the @MonadPlus@ gained with @MaybeT@ to help with @list@ shrinking}
